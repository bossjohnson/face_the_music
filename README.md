# Face the Music

Turn faces into music!

## Upload

Users can choose a local file to upload using a traditional interface, or they can drag and drop files into the upload box.  Users can even drag and drop images directly from the web.  All uploaded files are saved in a PostgreSQL database on Heroku.

## See all faces

By clicking on "All Faces" a user is shown every face in the database.  These faces play a melody when clicked.

## Sequencer

The user can drag and drop faces into the sequencer to create a series of faces, then play back the resulting melody.  Faces in the sequence can be rearranged or removed by dropping them outside of the sequencer box.  The user can select from all available faces in the row at the top of the screen.
